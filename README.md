# Spatial Analysis

This repository includes all the scripts used to for the spatial and temporal analysis. 

The (spatial_plots.py) file creates the plots for each individual FOV for each cell line. <br>
The (corrcoeffs_distance_df.py) exports a csv containing the PCC or STTC values and pairwise distances of cells in a FOV.< br>
The (event_add_distances.py) was used to create a csv for the ST-DBSCAN. < br>
(spatial_analysis.py) was used to calculated the percentages of correlations, the PCC and plot the PCC values with a 95% confidence interval. < br>
