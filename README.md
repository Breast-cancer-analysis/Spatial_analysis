# Spatial Analysis

This repository includes all the scripts used to for the spatial and temporal analysis. 

The spatial_plots.py file creates the plots for each individual FOV for each cell line. 

The corrcoeffs_distance_df.py exports a csv containing the PCC or STTC values and pairwise distances of cells in a FOV.

The event_add_distances.py was used to create a csv for the ST-DBSCAN. 

spatial_analysis.py was used to calculated the percentages of correlations, the PCC and plot the PCC values with a 95% confidence interval.
